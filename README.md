# ðŸ“¶ Flutter Connectivity Service

A clean, scalable solution to monitor internet connectivity across your entire Flutter app using a singleton service.

This service listens to real-time connectivity changes (WiFi, Mobile, or Offline) and shows a global "No Internet" dialog when disconnected. Designed with the **Single Responsibility Principle** in mind (part of SOLID principles) â€” it does one thing and does it well.
